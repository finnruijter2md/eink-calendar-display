# E-ink meeting room schedule & photo frame

This repository contains source code, models for 3D printing the case and instructions for creating a wireless e-ink device displaying schedule for a selected meeting room. After office hours the device can be turned into a photo frame featuring photos saved on a micro SD card. This makes it ideal e.g. for home office environment.

The device is based on the [Soldered Inkplate 6](https://soldered.com/product/soldered-inkplate-6-6-e-paper-board/) board that's available for ~110â‚¬. The earlier versions of Inkplate 6 (from e-radionica) are not supported.
